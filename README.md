This is the code repository for [Hands-On Artificial Intelligence for Search](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/hands-artificial-intelligence-search?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789611151), published by Packt.

**Building intelligent applications and perform enterprise searches**

## What is this book about?
In this book you will understand what is artificial intelligence. It explains in detail basic search methods: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS) and A* Search which can be used to make intelligent decisions when initial state, end state and possible actions are known. Random solutions or greedy solutions can be found for such problems.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the instances where searches can be used
* Understand the algorithms that can be used to make decisions more intelligent
* Formulate a problem by specifying its initial state, goal state, and actions
* Translate the concepts of the selected search algorithm into code
* Compare how basic search algorithms will perform for the application
* Implement algorithmic programming using code examples

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
def checkGoalState(self):
        """
        This method checks whether the person is Jill.
        """ 
        #check if the person's name is Jill
        return self.name == "Jill"
```
